## Installing Jupyter Notebook

### Install Python
First, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download and install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/).

### Install Jupyter Notebook
Once you have Python installed, open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install Jupyter Notebook using pip:
```bash
pip install jupyter
```

### Start Jupyter Notebook
After the installation is complete, you can start Jupyter Notebook by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
This will start the Jupyter Notebook server and open your default web browser to the Jupyter dashboard.

### Create a New Notebook
From the Jupyter dashboard, you can create a new notebook by clicking on the "New" button and selecting "Python 3" (or any other available kernel) under the "Notebooks" section. This will open a new Jupyter Notebook where you can start writing and executing Python code.

#### Alternatively
1. **Download Anaconda**: [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)
2. Once it's installed, start Anaconda Navigator.
3. From the main window, install "Jupyter Notebook".
4. Start Jupyter Notebook and Create a New Notebook:
   - From the Jupyter dashboard, click on the "New" button.
   - Select "Python 3" (or any other available kernel) under the "Notebooks" section.
   - This will open a new Jupyter Notebook where you can start writing and executing Python code.
